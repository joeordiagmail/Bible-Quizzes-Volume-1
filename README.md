# BIble Quizzes Volume 1
Bible Quizzes Volume 1
Bible Quizzes are written to spark your interest rather than to test your knowledge.

The Holy Bible is the word of God and the book of life.  It is a religious book, and an inspirational and uplifting work. It is also a historical document. 


I bring you a series of Bible Quizzes to share with you some of the most beautiful messages and lessons in the Holy Book.  It is not about how many correct answers you come up with. It is more about getting you to reflect on the message of peace and love that Jesus gave us. 

There will be several volumes, each with ten questions, and the correct answers will be provided at the end of each series. Reflect, contemplate, meditate, pray, and let the message be part of your life. 

Biblical era were difficult times, and now we live in a tumultuous period. But the message is the same. We must not despair. All problems can be solved through dialogue, prayers, and peaceful methods.  Those who are persecuted and aggrieved have a right to protest, but more can be achieved through peaceful demonstration than through revenge and violence. Silence can sometimes speak louder than 100 decibels. 

We are all children of God, and must learn the virtues of tolerance and forgiveness.  The greatest king who ever reigned conquered the world without raising a sword, or commanding an army. His mission on earth was to protect the poor and those who have been unfairly treated, and jailed.

“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound…..”

Spread the Gospel.  God bless you.

I thank God for everything.
